    "r - Read mode: This mode is used to read data from an existing file. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file, and if the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "w - Write mode: This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file already exists, it will be truncated and the file pointer will be placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "a - Append mode: This mode is used to append data to an existing file. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file, and if the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
